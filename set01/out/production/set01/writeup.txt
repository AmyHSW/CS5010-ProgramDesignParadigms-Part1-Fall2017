**Problem 4**
	Created a RandomHomework class to select a random course name from a list of 4 courses. To select a random course, a random number generator is declared and used to output a random entry of the courses array.

**Problem 5**
	The original Fibonacci.java failed 3 tests, which are all corrected in the modified Fibonacci.java â€”- 
1) Fixed the error that IllegalArgumentException is thrown when 0 is the argument; now exception is not thrown when 0 is passed.
2) Fixed the error that for n = 2, program returns 1; now it returns 2.
3) Fixed the error that for n > 2, program returns (getFibTerm(n - 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2)); now for n >= 2, program returns the sum of getFibTerm(n - 1) and getFibTerm(n - 1).
