/**
 * The <code>Patient</code> class represents a patient by arrival time, urgency level and treat time.

 * When the Patient starts examination, an ExaminationRoom will be set for the patient, and the departure
 * time can be calculated according to the start time of examination.
 *
 * The natural order of Patient is by urgency levels; if two Patients have the same urgency level, they
 * will be ordered by arrival time.
 *
 * Patient can also be ordered by departure time using the Comparator BY_DEPARTURE_TIME.
